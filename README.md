# Thermo Drone
From Search & Rescue to Agriculture, Thermal Imaging and Scanning have many applications. A fusion of the accuracy and power of Thermography and the efficiency and mobility of drones is the ultimate lifesaver for those needing rescue. 

Created by <b>Aryaman Aisola</b>, a student of <b>The Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet</b>, the Thermo Drone uses Infrared and Ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of humans and fires as well as the distance between them. The creation of this prototype required knowledge of electrical, electronic, and software engineering.

Be it in the wilderness of the jungle or the debris of a collapsed building, the Thermo Drone is here to help! This technology is used by the military for navigation and surveillance, firemen for fire detection and fire-fighting, scientists for agriculture and Phenotyping, and governments for inspecting power grids and solar farms. Its applications are vast and limitless!
 
But that’s not all… the entire thermal module can be controlled remotely using its very own mobile application. Through the power of Bluetooth technology operating the module is easy and accessible.
